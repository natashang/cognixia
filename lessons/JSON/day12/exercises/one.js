/*
    Exercise 3: 
    Design the function json=? that will determine if two JSONs
    are equal. Note that two JSONObjects are equal if all of their pairs 
    are equal. For the sake of simplicity, you can assume order matters here.

    Exercise 4:
    Design a function current-weather which given a RawJSON string 
    returns a [Listof String] of all the "description"s of the current
    weather from the data for the latest data point.

/* 
    Exercise 1:
    Write a template for JSON.  -- SEE ONE.JSON

    Note that JSONObjects and JSONArrays both contain JSON, 
    so you must write a template that is mutually recursive. 
    Since the template is just a comment, feel free to assume
    youâ€™ve already completed the next exercise.
